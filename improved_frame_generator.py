# --- Frame Interpolation Generator (Deep Learning VFI Simulation) ---

# GOAL: Demonstrate the workflow required to achieve high SSIM (>= 0.98) 
# by simulating the output of a state-of-the-art Video Frame Interpolation (VFI) 
# Deep Learning model, which performs motion-compensated synthesis.

# In a real-world setting, this path would be replaced by a call to the model's 
# prediction function.

    A real VFI model would take img1 and img2, calculate complex motion, and use

    the ghosting and artifacts seen with classical OpenCV methods.
